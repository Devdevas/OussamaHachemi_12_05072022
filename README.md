## Project 12 - SportSee - Front-End:
This repo contains the code needed to run the front-End for SportSee.

## Getting Started: 
## Project architecture:
This project is connected to a backend API service that you need to run locally.

The backend project to run the API locally can be found here: https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard.git

## Organize your workspace:
Create a SportSee folder where you will clone the backend project and then the frontend project:

Clone the backend project in the SportSee folder:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard.git
```

Clone the frontend project in the SportSee folder:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Devdevas/OussamaHachemi_12_05072022.git
```

## Launch the application locally:

### Step 1 - Launch the backend:

Follow the instructions in the README of the backend project.

### Step 2 - Launch the frontend:

Go to the cloned repo:
```
$ cd SportSee-Front-End
```

Install the npm packages (described in `package.json`) :
```
$ npm install
```

Launch the application :
```
$ npm start
```

Then go to: `http://localhost:3010/user/12` or `http://localhost:3010/user/18`.
